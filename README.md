# Emoji Labirinth
This was a game which I wrote for my Object Oriented Programming class.
* It used C++ and DirectX11 to draw the game.
* It's a 2D game in which you're a mouse trapped in a labirinth and can collect various emojis such as hearts/likes/cheese.
* You would have to also avoid enemies which roam around the labirinth (it was the first time I ever used a graph, used it to model enemy trajectories)
* You won a level by finding the exit and got bonus points for all the emojis you collected
* I implemented a lighting effect so you would only see the parts of the screen closer to you and have darkness the further you looked
* The levels were saved as txt files which I was parsing at startup
